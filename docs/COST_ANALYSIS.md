# Cost Analysis and Scaling Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document provides cost projections and optimization strategies for scaling the Shopify Size Chart Extractor service.

## Cost Projections

### Assumptions
- **Average Products per Store**: 100 products with size charts
- **Extraction Frequency**: Once per month per store (server runs only once monthly)
- **Success Rate**: 70% (30% failure rate due to site changes, blocking, etc.)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS/GCP cloud deployment (pay-per-use model)

### Monthly Cost Estimates

| Scale | Stores | Products | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Small** | 1,000 | 100,000 | $50-100 | $600-1,200 |
| **Medium** | 10,000 | 1,000,000 | $500-1,000 | $6,000-12,000 |
| **Large** | 100,000 | 10,000,000 | $5,000-10,000 | $60,000-120,000 |

### Optimized Costs (After Implementation)
| Scale | Original Cost | Optimized Cost | Savings |
|-------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| **Small** | $50-100 | $30-60 | 40% |
| **Medium** | $500-1,000 | $300-600 | 40% |
| **Large** | $5,000-10,000 | $3,000-6,000 | 40% |

## Primary Cost Drivers

### 1. **Proxy Services (40-50% of total cost)**
- **Why expensive**: IP rotation, residential proxies, high bandwidth
- **Cost**: $0.10-2.00 per GB depending on proxy type
- **Monthly usage**: 5-10 GB per 1,000 stores (one-time extraction)

### 2. **Compute Resources (30-40% of total cost)**
- **Why expensive**: Headless browser instances, memory-intensive operations
- **Cost**: $0.10-0.40 per hour for EC2 instances
- **Usage**: 2-4 vCPUs, 2-4 GB RAM for 2-4 hours monthly

### 3. **Database Storage (10-15% of total cost)**
- **Why expensive**: Historical data retention, JSON storage, indexing
- **Cost**: $0.023 per GB for S3 storage

### 4. **Network Bandwidth (5-10% of total cost)**
- **Why expensive**: Large page downloads, API responses
- **Usage**: ~5-10 MB per store (one-time extraction)

## Cost Reduction Strategies

### 1. **Architecture Improvements**
- **Microservices**: Auto-scaling based on demand
- **Containerization**: Resource optimization with Kubernetes
- **Load balancing**: Distribute processing across instances

### 2. **Proxy Optimization**
- **Smart selection**: Use free proxies for low-value stores
- **Pool management**: Rotate proxies based on success rates
- **Caching**: Remember successful proxy-store combinations

### 3. **Compute Optimization**
- **Resource pooling**: Reuse browser instances
- **Caching**: Multi-level cache (Redis → Disk → S3)
- **Scheduling**: Process high-value stores during peak hours

### 4. **Storage Optimization**
- **Compression**: Reduce storage requirements by 60-80%
- **Deduplication**: Avoid storing duplicate size charts
- **Tiered storage**: Hot (Redis) → Warm (S3) → Cold (Glacier)



## Key Trade-offs

### Speed vs. Cost
| Strategy | Cost Impact | Speed Impact | Recommendation |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Free proxies | -50% | -30% | Good for low-priority stores |
| Reduce browser instances | -20% | -40% | Use for batch processing |
| Increase cache TTL | -10% | +20% | Good balance |



## Conclusion

The service can scale efficiently with proper optimization, achieving 40% cost reduction through architectural improvements and intelligent resource management. The key is implementing optimizations incrementally while monitoring their impact on both cost and performance.

**Total potential savings**: 40% cost reduction across all scales
**Implementation timeline**: 12 months for full optimization
**ROI**: Break-even within 6-8 months of implementation
